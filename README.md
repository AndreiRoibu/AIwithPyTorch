# Machine Learning - PyTorch

Repo for course material from the "PyTorch: Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence" course on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/pytorch-deep-learning/)

In order to use GPUs and TPUs, for this course I will employ Google Colab. This is accordance with the instructions provided in the course. However, the content is in the form of Jupyter Notebooks, meaning that they should work on both local machines, and when uploaded to Google Colab.
